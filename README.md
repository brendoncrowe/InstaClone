# Insta Clone App
This is a clone app of an older verison of Instagram (for a more simpler project) that incorporates a lot of iOS development concepts, swift frameworks, firebase, and much more! </br>
The purpose of this app was to showcase much of what I have learned in the past 7 months. While there are so many other features to add, I am happy where the app is currently and may possibly continue to build out the app. However, there's a better alternative called Instagram! <br>
